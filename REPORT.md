# Hemmgechallangeproject

I have created this project in Angular. Have done the project very quickly (less than a day) so that the easiest and quickes way has been chosen isntead of the efficient way.

## Steps followed

Followed the wireframe design provided in the pdf and created different components for that 
Tried to match the UI properties to the maximum.

## Icons 

All the icons given are impremented at the correct positions



## Data provided in the DB file could is locked with a password so used dummy data.



##  Data Transfer betweeen components

Parent to child data communication is added


##  Table creation 

Table is autogenerated bsed on data


## All datas are dynamically added or updated to the UI


## Working 

The search Icon in the text box can be clicked

Clicking this will populate table with emails

## Inspection of Email body

Clicking the email icon in the first column will expand the table to show the email body
